        <div className = "paragraph"> Thank you for visiting. I'm Mathew Mani and this is my online portfolio. I am an engineering student at the University of Illinois at Chicago where I major in Computer Science. I started my journey in CS halfway through my sophomore year after transferring from finance. Since then, I have been rigorously taking classes year round to complete my degree. In the past year and a half, I have gone from organizing data in python to studying the mathematics of machine learning. My goal is to further my education in this field and gain experience in the workforce to enhance my knowledge of the subject as well as advancing my career. Much of the experience I have gained from school has been backend oriented; much of the projects are analyzing and organizing data, utilizing data structures, creating data structures, and creating terminal games. To see these projects in more detail, please visit the projects tab in the navigation bar. Since I didnâ€™t understand how websites and applications were made in full, I decided to learn about user interfaces during the past summer while also taking school courses as a step to become a full stack software engineer. I decided to learn REACT, which is what I utilized to make this website as well as another side project. Although I have made substantial progress in my short journey, I understand that learning is never complete. Because of this, I strive to meet more challenges and obstacles in order to deepen my knowledge of this field. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio, and I hope to connect with you soon.</div>
