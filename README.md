# About
This online portfolio serves as a database for my technical experience I gained both in school and extracurricularly. From the home page, you can direct to the 'projects' page as well as the 'education' page. From 'projects', you can view either my school projects or side projects. From there, you could select certain prompts to view pictures of said projects running. From 'education', you can view all of the relevant coursework I have completed. By clicking on the courses, you can view the description of each course. This project is currently only available on desktop and was deployed using netlify.
